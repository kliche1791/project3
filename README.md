​
## Description
​
MyNewsNow is a custom web scraping app, which will eventually be integrated with Alexa as a skill. We believe this app has value in that it allows the user to carefully curate the topics that are important to them and to see various news articles from across the internet.
​
### How to interact
​
1. A webpage with a username/login. The user will provide topics for scraping. The scraped topic material will be stored in a database. These results will be displayed on the webpage in a formatted boxed style.
​
2. An Alexa skill will be created to interact with the app. User will be able to issue a voice command to prepare a custom newsfeed basic on one of their chosen topics.
